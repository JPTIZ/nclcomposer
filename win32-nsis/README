NCL Composer Win32 Release
==========================
This directory contains all files related to generate a win32 release.

Today, there are the follwing files:

  * README: This file.
  * FileAssociation.nsh: A NSIS library used by composer.nsi.
  * composer.nsi: The main NSIS script to generate NCL Composer installer.
  * generate-release.bat: A helpful .bat to generate .ZIP and NSIS releases.

Generating a release
====================
The easiest (and recommended) way to generate an NCL Composer release is 
through the generate-release.bat script.

Before running it, you must be sure that all the necessary dependencies are
installed and configured.

Dependencies
------------
In order to get this script up and running you will need the following
softwares installed in your Windows machine and properly configured in PATH:

  * git >= 1.7x (http://git-scm.com)
  * Qt >=4.7.x (http://qt.digia.com)
  * NSIS >= 2.46 (http://nsis.sourceforge.net)
  * 7zip >= 9.20 (http://www.7-zip.org)
  
Again, make sure all these programs are CONFIGURED IN PATH, because the
generate-release.bat will assume it.

Changing version
----------------
The current version of generate-release.bat will get the NCL Composer version
automatically from tag configured in project:

   * composer-plugins.git

However you can set this version by hand uncommenting and editing the line:

  REM - SET CPRVERSION=0.1.4

inside the generate-release.bat script.

Compiling and releasing
-----------------------
After be sure that all dependencies are installed and the version of NCL
Composer is properly configured you are able to run (inside win32-nsis
directory):

  $ generate-release.bat

If everything run OK the following files should be created (and are ready to 
be available):

  * nclcomposer-{VERSION}.zip
  * nclcomposer-installer-{VERSION}.exe
