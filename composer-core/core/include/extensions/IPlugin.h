//!  The interface for communication between the core and the plugin
/*!
  This extension point is used by the core to emit and receive signals.
  These signals are transmited by the plugin to the core, and then the core
  retransmit this signal to the other plugins associated with the NclDocument.
  All the communication is performed using the signal/slot mechanism provided
  by QT. The plugin developer needs to implement all the slots in order to
  capture the changes in the NclDocument and emit the signals when itself makes
  a change.
