This project is intended to group all NCL Composer projects using the git
submodulesi featuere. This project does not contain any source code, it just 
uses the abstraction of git submodules to link to git projects where the code
of each individual project is available. 

Additionally, this project also brings some useful files and scripts related to
code documentation, like Doxyfile, scripts to add the License HEAD to files,
and so on.

Today, there are three main submodules inside this project:
  * composer-core
  * composer-gui
  * composer-plugins

======================================
=== Getting Submodules Source Code ===
======================================
The easier way to get the submodules projects is by running:

  $ qmake

in the root directory of this projects.

The first time you run qmake, it will initialize and update the submodules,
getting all the necessary source code for compile NCL Composer. 

By default, every submodule will be changed to branch master.

If you want do it yourself you can execute the following commands:
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update
  $ git submodule foreach "git checkout master"

=======================================
== Changing and Committing the code  ==
=======================================
Even put together in the same root, each git project is independent. So,
each change, commit and push must be realized individually to each submodules.
