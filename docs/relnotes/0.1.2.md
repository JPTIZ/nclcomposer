NCL Composer v0.1.2 Release Notes
=================================

NCL Composer v0.1.2 is mainly a improvement over the v0.1.1.


Updates since v0.1.1
--------------------

New features & UI (GUI and Plug-ins)

  * A theme system that allows the NCL Composer to be fully-customized through a
    CSS like syntax (based on QSS system).

  * A notify system that allow us to notify users of new releases, events, etc.

  * Marking entities with error (links and medias) in the 'Structural View'.

  * Autocomplete to xconnectors while creating a new link in the 'Structural
    View'

  * Allows the user to show a grid in the 'Layout View', that can help while the
    user is indicating where the media will be presented.


Performance & Internal Implementation

  * Improvements in the Run over SSH feature. Now, only files that have been
    modified since the last run are sent to remote machine again.

  * Full-revised default connector base document.

  * And various bug fixes :)
