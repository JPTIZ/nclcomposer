NCL Text Editor customizes some code of original QScintilla. The changes are 
very simple, and mainly add NCLLexer to Scintilla.

In order to apply the changes provided here you should go to your QScintilla 
root path. For instance: 

  $ cd QScintilla-gpl-snapshot-2.5.2-d31c561e0b7c/

Then, apply add_ncl_lexer_to_scintilla.patch with:

  $ patch -p0 <../add_ncl_lexer_to_scintilla.patch

See if the src/Catalogue.cpp has a line:

  LINK_LEXER(lmNCL);

Then, go to include dir and run HFacer.py script:

  $ cd include
  $ python HFacer.py

Now, you are able to go to Qt4 directory inside QScintilla tree, and build and
install QScintilla:

  $ cd ../Qt4
  $ qmake 
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
