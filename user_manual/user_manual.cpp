\section Introduction
NCL Composer is a multiplataform and extensible tool that helps you to create
and manipulate Nested Context Language documents for interactive digital TV.

It can help you in many ways:
- Providing autocomplete and validation features to text-based authoring.
- Providing graphical abstraction over NCL source code aiming to easy the
  authorship for non-programmers (e.g a structural and layout representation of
  the document).
- Providing transmition plugins that easy the task to send your application
  over the air or over an IPTV network.
